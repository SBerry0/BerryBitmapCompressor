| Nov. 15 | 10:15-11:00am | First I spent some time to figure out what the mystery was (it's a duck). Then I tried to do something with how many consecutive numbers there are. I was going to do something like have the first bit of a group of data being 0 or 1, depending on if it's a streak of 0s or 1s. Then the next few bits would represent how many in a row there are. Instead I did something a little different, where I am trying to only write out the position of each 1, which does not work right now, but it's not looking promising. |

I think I'm on the right track now, but I am running into a runtime error right now. |
