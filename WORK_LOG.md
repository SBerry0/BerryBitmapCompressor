Then I tried to do something with how many consecutive numbers there are. I was going to do something like have the first bit of a group of data being 0 or 1, depending on if it's a streak of 0s or 1s. Then the next few bits would represent how many in a row there are. Instead I did something a little different, where I am trying to only write out the position of each 1, which does not work right now, but it's not looking promising. |

I think I'm on the right track now, but I am running into a runtime error right now. |
| Nov. 18 |  4:30-5:15pm  | I tried a few different things to fix that error I was getting. I first figured out how to use a plugin that would allow me to see the binary files in binary which made checking what was going wrong much easier because I didn't have to run a command. I realized that readString worked completely different than how I was thinking it worked: I thought it would read each 1 and 0 into a string which I could parse, but no, and it's annoying because I knew that I just didn't realize it wouldn't work like that in the moment and for the many minutes debugging. But, still doesn't work, still running into the error, going to take a break now. |

Unfortunately though, my compressed file is 200 bits larger than the regular file, so no bueno. |

I get a 19% compression ratio on the mystery file and about 50% on the medium size, but this doesn't use Sedgewick's algorithm. I'll make that one too and compare to see which does better. |

It looks like it should work in my head but I'm running into a NoSuchElementException. I did also change to using a queue in this version which works in my original solution, but not this one. I will change it back to the string then test now. |
